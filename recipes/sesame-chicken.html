        any time of day! I prefer less seeds but its still good either way.</em>

<h2>Describing the Chicken</h2>

<p>
    First off, this is a <strong>very easy</strong> meal to cook, only needing few ingredients, and is really tasty in 
    the end. Its great for mom's who have all their time spent on their kids, dad's who can't cook
    super well, and for anyone who wants a good tasty meal quickly. Its so simple even <strong>kids can cook
    it as well!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Overall, its a sweet and salty meal, that gives good protien and calories to your day. The rice is also nice and 
    provides a sticky and soft contrast to the chicken. The seeds give it a good crunch too!
    It does take a few hours, but using a slow cooker, can be done during the work day! 
</p>

<p>
    You want to cook the chiken and then begin with the sauce and rice. After mixing the sauce part, you want to cool
    it in the fridge during cooking of the chicken. The rice can be made in a rice cooker, its the easiest way. Just 
    pop it in for 20 minutes. After the chicken is done, marinate it with the sauce. Then you want to season it with
    salt, pepper, and (of course) sesame seeds! Finally lie it on top of the rice and serve it!
