<h2>Describing the Burger</h2>

<p>
    Another easy and declicious meal for you to eat. Super simple and has been around for ages. Its not super healthy
    but you are not going to think about the calories as you dig into this tasty feast! Also, most kids will eat one
    so don't worry ab</ol>li></li>out your kid saying, "Mom! I want McDonalds! This food <em><strong>sucks!</strong></em>"

    You want to mix ground beef with the seasonings and form it into a patty. Throw it on a pan or grill, and cook it.
    Fries are optional, but honestly isn't needed because its so <strong>filling!</strong> If you want, you can grill
    and lightly butter the buns for extra flavor!
